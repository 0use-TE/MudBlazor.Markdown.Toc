一名热爱 .NET 的开发者，代码如诗，架构如画。我钟情于微软技术栈，后端用 Web API，前端玩 MudBlazor，偶尔还会折腾 Unity。

说起我啊，从小就喜欢玩游戏，喜欢摆弄电脑。13 岁那年，我开始折腾装机，学习各种电脑组装知识，给别人配电脑💻、装系统，完全不在话下。到了高中，我开始接触编程，但奈何学业繁忙，没能坚持太久……直到上了大学，我终于彻底沉迷在了编程的世界。记得第一次走进学校图书馆的自然科学书籍区，我惊讶得说不出话——天哪，这里竟然有这么多关于计算机、电子、数学的书籍！从那一刻起，我便下定决心，要用代码去探索世界，去创造价值。我坚信，代码不仅仅是工具，更是一种艺术，而编程，是我与世界对话的方式。

除了写代码，我还养了一只名叫 Code（扣嘚）的非洲迷你刺猬🦔，它是我调试 bug 时最忠实的听众。我喜欢生椰拿铁☕，喜欢音乐，喜欢一切能让世界变得更有秩序的东西。这个博客是我思考与成长的记录，关于技术，关于生活，也关于代码之外的世界。😁
### Hello, I'm Ouse 👋

A passionate .NET developer who sees code as poetry and architecture as art. I’m deeply in love with the Microsoft tech stack, building backends with Web API, crafting frontends with MudBlazor, and occasionally dabbling in Unity.

As for me, I’ve been fascinated by games and computers since I was a kid. At 13, I started tinkering with PC building, learning all about hardware assembly, helping others set up their computers💻, and installing systems—it was a breeze. In high school, I dipped my toes into programming, but with a heavy academic load, I couldn’t stick with it for long… until university, when I finally fell headfirst into the world of coding. I still remember stepping into the natural sciences section of the university library for the first time—I was speechless. “Wow, there are so many books on computers, electronics, and math!” From that moment, I resolved to explore the world through code and create value with it. I firmly believe that code isn’t just a tool—it’s an art form, and programming is my way of conversing with the world.

Beyond coding, I have a little African pygmy hedgehog named Code🦔, my most loyal listener when I’m debugging. I enjoy coconut lattes☕, music, and anything that brings more order to the world. This blog is a record of my thoughts and growth—about tech, life, and the world beyond code. 😁";
